# Anya-Anand-Portfolio

Final project completed for Fall 2023 Semester in COS 126. This project applied concepts throughout the entire semester in order to
verify Brownian motion, Einstein's model, and estimate Avogadro's number. This was a culminating project where Blob, BeadFinder, and 
BeadTracker all build on eachother. Avogadro serves as a separate class to estimate Avogadro's number.
